The included version of Knil has a very simple objective, 
you must help GoodGuy by getting his three Items for him.
One item is inside the house, in the top left corner, the
second item is downstairs in the basement, and the third is
hidden in the forest (It's beside a tree trunk). Once you 
have collected these three items, GoodGuy will reveal the 
easter egg.
